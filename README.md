# number guessing game
i made a small number guessing game using python.
a computer will chose a random number between 1 and 10 then prompt a human player to 
guess what the chosen number by the computer was by typing in an input box in the terminal.
if the typed number is not the chosen number by the computer counterpart, a human player will receive trials untill s(he) types a correct number.
